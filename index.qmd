I am a Sr. Data Scientist at Microsoft. I have an extensive background working with varied data sets and using advanced analytics to enable business stakeholders to make informed decisions.

I recently expanded my skill set to include topics like Quarto, tidymodels, working in cross-language R/Python environment using reticulate, and data visualizations using animation and interactivity. I love learning new things constantly and sharing my knowledge with others in a digestible manner.
